```

## How It Works 🧑‍💻

1. **Add tasks**: 
   - Users can add new tasks by typing in the input field and clicking the "Add Task" button or pressing `Enter`.
   - Each task is assigned a unique identifier using the UUID library.

2. **Mark tasks as completed**:
   - By clicking the check icon next to a task, the task is marked as completed (with a line-through effect).
   - The check icon color changes when a task is completed.

3. **Delete tasks**:
   - Click the trash icon to remove a task from the list.

4. **Snowflakes animation**:
   - Snowflakes are generated dynamically using CSS animations for a fun, wintery aesthetic.
   - Snowflakes move from top to bottom and fade out as they fall.

## Styling 🎨

- **Global Styles**: The app uses a simple, minimalistic design with a dark background and neon accents for a modern, clean look.
- **Animations**: Snowflakes fall from the top of the screen, with each snowflake having a random position and animation duration for variation.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

## Dependencies 📦

- **react**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **react-dom**: Package for DOM rendering in React.
- **uuid**: Generates unique identifiers for tasks.
- **@fortawesome/react-fontawesome**: For Font Awesome icons like the trash and check icons.

You can find all dependencies in the `package.json` file.
